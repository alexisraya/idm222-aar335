                <p class = "project-section__text">The goal of this project was to create a responsive portfolio website. Previously, I had a portfolio website that was not responsive for non-mobile devices (view my previous site here). With this redesign, I re-programmed the site from scratch and used previous design elements to create a more presentable and personal website.</p>

                <h5 class = "project-section__title">The Design</h5>
                <p class = "project-section__text">In this design I wanted to include elements that fit my personality and style. Because of this, I chose to go with a brown color scheme with a desaturated blue for hyperlinks. It reminded me of coffee and the earth, which are two things that relate to my coffee making and gardening hobbies.</p>

                <p class = "project-section__text">For the overall design of the site, I wanted it to feel clean and personable. I chose Work Sans to be my main font because of its roundness and legibility. Additionally, I chose for my buttons to have rounded corners to create a softer feel.</p>

                <p class = "project-section__text">During this project, I learned how to use flexbox and grid in my css code. I chose to style most of my elements with flexbox because of its fluidity. This was very useful for elements that included a lot of text such as the header or the intro text.</p>

                </div>
                <p class = "project-section__text">However, I recognized the power of using flexbox and grid together and used it to style the div that contained my project sections. I found this to be very useful especially in my media queries when I would just minimize the amount of columns in my projects.</p>

                <p class = "project-section__text">I really enjoyed designing and programming this project. Creating this site made me more invested and interested in learning more about web development and increasing my programming knowledge. I’m excited to learn other ways to program websites and applications such as Node.JS. Overall, I’m very proud of the design and programming that went into making this site.</p>
