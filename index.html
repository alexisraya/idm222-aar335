                    I was tasked with designing and rebranding an app of my choice as well as develop the interactions for the app. This included analyzing the a task flow and app flow of MyWater and developing a high fidelity wireframe, wire flow, IX flow, interaction guides, an an animated prototype for Hydrate. The programs used for this design were Figma and Adobe After Effects.

Their mission is to create a more informed public. NPR are storytellers that connect across the country to explore the news, ideas, and what it means to be human.

                    Through observations and by speaking to the staff, three main improvements were found that can be made.

                    These improvements focus around library patrons understanding when their books have been returned, optimizing their calendar, and having librarians understand when users have turned in their books.  </p>
