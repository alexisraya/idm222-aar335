                    Stardew Valley Zodiac is a delightful twist on the traditional zodiac chart. In this website, users are able to input their birthday and find out which Stardew Valley character matches them. There are 12 characters and each character has a birthday range that corresponds to the traditional zodiac chart.

                    My role for this project was to design and program the site. This site includes the main task of the user finding out their character, a help button, and music that can be paused. This site was developed with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Figma.

                    I wanted to keep the design of the site very simple while still keeping the bright and fun theme of Stardew Valley. Because of this, I went with a light color scheme and used a screenshot of the Stardew loading page as the background. Additionally, I went with a pixel typeface to match the pixel style of the video game.

                    The HTML and CSS for this code was relatively short. Most of the elements were broken up into divs and contained in one large div so that I could style it to be in the center of the screen. Additionally, this site was styled using flexbox, which helped make this site responsive.

                    The programming for the function that gave the user their respective character consisted of 12 if-statements that set the user’s character and character image when the condition was met.

                    The functions to show the help screen and play/pause music, both had a flag that indicated whether or not the screen was showing or the music was playing. When either button was clicked, the function would check the respective flag and act accordingly. For example, if isPlaying was true and the pause button was pressed, then the music would pause.

                    This project was very enjoyable to make. Additionally, it was my first time implementing Javascript in a website. I was excited to program in Javascript and learn more about web development, especially because of my background in computer programming. I’m looking forward to learning more advanced web programming in the near future!
